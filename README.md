# ðŸ›’ Optimization of Target's Queue Management Using Simulation Modeling

This project uses simulation modeling to optimize queue management at Target retail stores by comparing cashier lanes with self-checkout systems. The model was built to address inefficiencies in customer wait times and underutilized cashier lanes, aiming to enhance operational performance and customer satisfaction.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

**Team Members:**  
Raheela Charania, Anmol Anchala, Emmanuel Wediko

**Objective:**  
To reduce customer wait times and optimize resource utilization at Target by evaluating the performance of cashier lanes vs. self-checkout kiosks through simulation modeling.

## ðŸ“ˆ Problem Statement

Target faces long customer wait times and inefficient cashier lane usage. Our simulation aimed to:
- Analyze current queue configurations
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Recommend queue structure improvements

## ðŸ”§ Methodology

1. **Simulation Modeling:**  
   Created two process flow diagrams:
   - Traditional cashier queues
   - Self-checkout kiosks

2. **Assumptions:**
   - No queue reneging (customers donâ€™t leave lines)
   - Equal sample size representation across systems
   - Checkout station capacity fixed per type
   - Data collected over 10 replications

3. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Queue lengths and wait times
   - Service times per kiosk or cashier
   - Utilization rates

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- **Self-checkout kiosks** showed **100% utilization**
- Cashier lanes were consistently underutilized
- Customers experienced **longer wait times** in traditional lanes

## âœ… Recommendations

- Increase number of self-checkout kiosks
- Reduce the number of cashier lanes
- Collect additional data across multiple days and time periods for improved model accuracy

## ðŸ§  Future Work

- Implement real-time data logging from Target stores
- Test queue variations with dynamic customer behavior (e.g., reneging or switching lines)
- Expand to other retail environments for comparative analysis
